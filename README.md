# Deep Learning Image Classifier with PyTorch and Streamlit

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a web-based image classification application using PyTorch and Streamlit. The application allows users to upload an image and receive a classification result. The initial setup uses a pre-trained ResNet18 model. Your task is to modify and improve the model, experimenting with different architectures or training strategies to enhance its performance.

## Objective
- Learn how to integrate a deep learning model with a Streamlit web application.
- Gain hands-on experience in modifying and improving deep learning models.
- Understand the process of deploying a machine learning model in a practical application.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision streamlit pillow
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: The main script for the Streamlit application.
- `model.py`: Script where the PyTorch model is defined and loaded.
- `README.md`: This file with project details and instructions.

## Tasks
1. **Model Modification**: Modify the `model.py` file to change the deep learning model. You can choose to:
   - Use a different pre-trained model from PyTorch's model hub.
   - Modify the existing ResNet18 model by changing its layers or parameters.
   - Train the model on a new dataset or fine-tune it for better performance on specific types of images.

2. **Experimentation and Testing**: Experiment with different models and configurations. Test the performance of your modified model and compare it to the original setup.

3. **Documentation**: Update this README with details about your modifications. Include:
   - The rationale behind your chosen modifications.
   - Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
   - Performance comparisons between the original and modified models.

4. **Presentation**: Prepare a brief presentation or report summarizing your work, findings, and learning outcomes from this project.

## Additional Notes
- Remember to manage dependencies and environments to avoid version conflicts.
- Use Git for version control to track your changes and experiments.
- Be creative and don't hesitate to try innovative approaches!

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit the modified code along with an updated README.
- Include a brief report or presentation summarizing your approach and findings.
